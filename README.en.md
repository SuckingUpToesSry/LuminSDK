## About

LuminSDK is an **open-source browser game portal**. It loads a catalog of 1,100+ games through the
[LuminSDK](https://docs.luminsdk.com/) and renders them with a custom interface built from scratch:
instant search, category filters, sorting, a random picker, pagination and a fullscreen game player.

Open the page and play — no account, no download, no installation.

## Features

- 🎮 **Full catalog** — 1,100+ games served by LuminSDK in a dense grid of up to **9 columns**.
- ❤️ **Favorites** — save games with one click; they stay in your browser.
- 🕘 **Continue playing** — a short history of recently opened games.
- 🎛️ **Custom grid** — **columns** and **rows** sliders plus **card size** (S/M/L); pagination recalculates itself.
- 🖌️ **Per-game colors** — each game can have its own accent color, saved locally.
- 🎛️ **Customization (21 options)** — theme, 16 preset colors, font, corners, density, animation speed and 17 effect switches (particles, parallax, cursor, blurs, hover, Y2K, chrome, gloss, neon, glow, stars, bubbles, grid, noise, scanlines). Includes automatic device detection, **light** / **full** presets and a **personal suggestion** built from your device and your history.
- ✦ **For you** — a recommendation rail built from the categories you play most and your favorites; shuffle it or hide it for today.
- 🎯 **Daily challenges** — three goals drawn per day (sessions, minutes, variety, category and evening play), with progress, a day streak and a notice when completed.
- 🏆 **Achievements** — 17 local medals (first session, marathons, day streaks, late nights, favorites…) with an on-screen notice and progress saved in the browser.
- 📊 **Player statistics** — sessions, total time, unique games, day streak, a last-7-days chart, favorite categories and most-played games.
- ✨ **Y2K look** — chrome titles, glass buttons, rising bubbles, star field, scanlines and bubble corners — every effect can be switched off on its own.
- 📦 **Backup** — export/import favorites, history, colors and grid as JSON.
- 🎁 **Bonus** — a tools hub: gamepad tester (built for the Xbox controller and browser), connection monitor and cache manager.
- 🎨 **Color palette** — 16 presets plus a free color picker and hue slider: the whole site (buttons, glows, particles, cursor) recolors instantly and is saved.
- ✨ **Living atmosphere** — canvas particles in the chosen color (halo, twinkle and a glow that follows the pointer), a parallax background and a custom cursor with a glowing ring. They are on by default — even with "reduce motion" enabled, which stops the autonomous animation but keeps the dots reacting to the pointer.
- 🔗 **One address only** — `…/LuminSDK/` and nothing more: search, category, page, favorites and an open game never touch the URL.
- 🔎 **Debounced search** with smart empty states.
- 🏷️ **Dynamic categories** pulled straight from the SDK.
- 🔀 **Random picker** — button for when you can't decide.
- 🖥️ **Custom player** — fullscreen, restart, open in a new tab and skeleton loading.
- 🌗 **Light & dark themes**, saved in `localStorage`, honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — no framework, no bundler.
- ♿ **Accessible** — keyboard support, visible focus, `aria-live` updates.
- 📲 **Installable (PWA)** — manifest, icons and a service worker for offline app-shell.
- 🛟 **Resilient** — falls back to the SDK's built-in UI if the custom one fails,
  and ships a demo mode (`?demo`) for offline layout work.

## One URL, two modes and four tabs

**Everything happens at `https://suckinguptoessry.github.io/LuminSDK/`** — nothing after the last
slash.

On load you get **two doors**: **OS** and **Normal**. The pick lives only in this session
(`luminsdk:v1:mode`) and can be changed at any time from the system menu (⏻ in OS mode) or the
floating **LuminOS** button. The URL stays exactly the same in both modes.

| Mode | What it is |
|---|---|
| **OS** | **LuminOS**: a dark desktop with wallpapers, a dock, draggable windows with minimize/maximize and real apps (Games, Browser, Sites, Chat, Notes, Calculator, Settings, About). |
| **Normal** | The site as it always was: game catalog, side tabs and the study portal. | Switching tabs, searching, filtering favorites, opening settings, playing, opening the study
portal: none of it changes the address. No `/gn/`, no `/sites/`, no `#/anything`, no `?cat=`. Copy the
URL in the middle of a game and it is still just `…/LuminSDK/`.

How it works (`assets/js/app.js`):

- the four tabs are four `.app-view` blocks inside the **same** `index.html`;
- clicking a tab (or the shortcut) only swaps which block is visible — `history` is never touched;
- the chosen tab lives in `sessionStorage` (`luminsdk:v1:start`), so reloading keeps the tab you were
  in, still on the same URL;
- each tab's CSS and JS are fetched **the first time** it opens, and only the active tab's stylesheet
  stays enabled (Study is light and must not leak into the rest).

| Tab | What it is |
|---|---|
| **LuminSDK** (rail: "Lumin") | The main catalog served by the LuminSDK API — unchanged. |
| **GN-Math** | A parallel library with the public GN-Math collection, with its own look, settings, cursor, favorites and history. |
| **Sites** | Other sites that open **inside** LuminSDK, in a built-in viewer (a site within a site). |
| **Study** | StudyDesk: a real study portal (subjects, resources, planner, quiz, FAQ). Works as a **decoy** and as a study tool. |

The `gn/`, `sites/` and `study/` folders are now just **compatibility shortcuts**: anyone with an old
address saved is sent back to `…/LuminSDK/` already on the right tab.

### LuminOS (OS mode)

OS mode is a real desktop inside the same page:

- **windows** you can drag, minimize, maximize and close (full screen on phones);
- a **dock** with eight apps plus **desktop shortcuts**;
- **wallpapers** (aurora, midnight, forest, paper) and an **accent colour**, saved in `luminsdk:v1:os`;
- **Games**: the 848 GN-Math titles with covers (four mirrors, monogram fallback) and a built-in player
  with back, reload and open-in-new-tab;
- **Browser**: address bar, home with the main collections and an honest notice when a site refuses to
  be embedded;
- **Sites**: the 67 collections in a searchable list (they open in the Browser);
- **Notes** (saved locally), **Calculator**, **Settings** and **About**.

### Live presence and global chat

Two floating pieces follow the site — and hide on Study, on the entry screen and **while a game is
open**, coming back when it closes:

- **People counter** (`1 pessoa online`): every tab checks in every 15 s and the number counts whoever
  showed up in the last 75 s.
- **Global chat**: no sign-up — pick a name and talk. The list keeps **100 messages** in the browser
  (`luminsdk:v1:chat`): when the 101st arrives, the oldest goes, one at a time. Messages try to travel
  between visitors through the public `ntfy.sh` relay; if the relay is unavailable the chat keeps
  working across tabs of the same browser (`BroadcastChannel`) and the panel says **“modo local”** — it
  never pretends a message was sent.

> The site is static (GitHub Pages), so **there is no database**: messages live in the reader's browser
> and, when the public relay is up, reach whoever is online. The 100-message limit applies to that list.

### Sites tab

The Sites tab holds **67 collections / 749 links**, already cleaned, de-duplicated and properly
named: **Games** (Eaglercraft, Frogies Arcade, GTA V Port, Subway Surfers, Super Mario 64),
**Packs** (Flight Academy with 34 subdomains, C00lKid, Bagatz) and **Study** (Revault, Fern, Solara,
Astra, Aether, Opium, Galaxy, Duck Math, GN-Math, LuminalOS, N7x, Petezah's Study, CatClass/cat4z, Bull 33, Bonus,
Aurora, DogeUB, Tung Tung, Velara, Selenite, Cherri, Voya, Xylora, Interstellar, Utopia, Rook, Kite,
plus the mirrors grouped by domain: `tribeoftwo.com`, `streetdirectory.sg`,
`solidaritysafaris.com`, `rusticrivergear.com`, `nextcomm.com.ar`, `amazonaws.com`, `govt.hu`,
`lirr.space` and more). Every collection has its own **image**: local art for LuminSDK, Links, LuminalOS, N7x, Aurora, Solara,
Galaxy V7, Revault and Petezah; official logos for Astra, Duck Math, Opium, Fern, Cherri and the rest —
and when an image fails, the coloured monogram takes over.

Each collection is a single collapsed row — logo (or a coloured monogram), name, link count and
category. Opening it shows the links in a compact grid: clicking one opens the site **right there**,
while `↗` opens it in a new tab. There is instant search (name and address), **All / Games / Packs /
Study** filters. None of it touches the URL — the viewer state lives in memory only.

The viewer has a title bar, reload, fullscreen, “open in a new tab” and close (`Esc`). Rows are only
built when a collection is opened, so the page stays light even with hundreds of links.

Tab artwork: `assets/img/sites-hero.jpg` (1440 px) and `sites-hero-sm.jpg` (760 px, small screens).

### Clean tab: when a site refuses to be embedded

Many of those addresses send `X-Frame-Options`/`Content-Security-Policy` and **refuse** to be
embedded — the iframe goes blank, and no LuminSDK code can get around it (the browser is obeying the
hosted site).

So LuminSDK does this:

1. **Tries inline** as usual.
2. If the page does not load within 10 s (or loads instantly and blank), the address is remembered in
   `localStorage` and the site opens in a **clean tab**: an `about:blank` tab where LuminSDK writes a
   loading screen and only then navigates to the address, with `referrer` off and `window.opener`
   cut. Same page, same study material, just in a tab with no link back to the previous one — which
   makes several school/network filters let it through.
3. The viewer note stays available with **“Open in a new tab”** and **“Try inline again”** (which
   clears the flag).
4. The **“Open in a new tab”** button next to the filters turns that mode on for *every* site, if you
   prefer it that way. Each row's `↗` also goes through the clean tab.

> The list of addresses that failed lives only in your browser (`luminsdk:v1:sites:blocked`), never in
> the repository.

To add, rename or remove links, edit **`assets/data/sites.json`** — it is the tab's single data
source and needs no build:

```json
{ "v": 2, "families": [
  { "id": "solara", "name": "Solara", "cat": "estudo", "logo": "https://…/logo.png",
    "sites": [ { "name": "solara", "url": "https://solara.polimont.com.br/" } ] }
] }
```

`cat` is `jogos`, `pacotes` or `estudo`. `logo` is optional (without it the collection gets a monogram
tinted from its name). Credit for the original links goes to **ByePassHub** (GitHub), named in the
tab's footer.

### Study tab (StudyDesk) and the decoy

The Study tab is a **light, school-looking** page, isolated from the rest of the site: subjects,
resources with search and filters, a task planner with a progress bar, a **focus timer** (25/10/5 min),
a **quick quiz** of five questions with instant feedback and an **FAQ** section with six questions.
Nothing there pulls games — it is study only, and it works as a real tool.

**The site opens on Study.** Anyone typing `…/LuminSDK/` lands on StudyDesk (the URL stays exactly
the same), so the first impression is a study portal. The games catalog shows up when the visitor:

- clicks **Ryan Smith** in the StudyDesk footer, or
- presses **`Shift` + `D`** (or **`Alt` + `S`**) — the *two-key combo* that toggles between Study and
  the site from any tab.

| Action | What happens |
|---|---|
| opening `…/LuminSDK/` | lands on StudyDesk |
| **`Shift` + `D`** / **`Alt` + `S`** | toggles Study ⇄ site (works on any tab, even inside a game) |
| **Study** tab in the left rail | opens StudyDesk |
| clicking **Ryan Smith** in the StudyDesk footer | opens LuminSDK |
| **Lumin** tab in the left rail | opens LuminSDK |

The choice is kept in `sessionStorage`, so the URL **never** changes — neither way.

Entry is decided by `assets/js/app.js` (the same file that switches tabs), the shortcut lives there and
the way out in `assets/js/study.js`. The single-file build (`single/index.html`) has **no** Study tab —
it is always the games catalog. Each file
is independent: nothing from StudyDesk leaks into LuminSDK's dark look.

The **GN-Math** tab is a separate page, not a theme: graphite background with a grid, a crosshair
cursor, its own settings panel (accent colour, background, cursor, density, effects, motion), search,
category filters, sorting and “continue playing”. Opening a game does **not** change the URL.
Preferences live in `gnmath:v1:*`, apart from `luminsdk:v1:*` — changing one tab never touches the other.

GN-Math games come from that project's public CDN (`freebuisness/html`, covers from
`freebuisness/covers`). To refresh the list:

```bash
python3 tools/gnmath-sync.py          # downloads zones.json and rewrites assets/data/gnmath-games.json
```

Every game runs inside the player: the page fetches the game HTML, injects a `<base>` pointing at the
right folder (the same trick the GN-Math site uses) and writes it into the iframe. YouTube Playables
entries get a notice plus an “open in a new tab” button.

---

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuckingUpToesSry/LuminSDK.git
cd LuminSDK

python3 -m http.server 8080
# or: npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

### Use it as a starting point

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Edit the copy, colors and branding in `index.html` and `assets/css/styles.css`.
3. Enable **GitHub Pages** under *Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / root*.
4. Ship it — there is no build step.

### Export to another repository (portable package)

```bash
# 1. fill in your project data
nano tools/package.config.json   # projectName, author, repoUrl, siteUrl, basePath, sdkUrl

# 2. build the folder + zip
./tools/package.sh               # or: python3 tools/package.py
```

Output:

- `export/luminsdk-portable/` — drop-in contents for the new repository
- `export/luminsdk-portable.zip` — the same package, zipped

The packager copies only what the site needs, rewrites every project link, and generates a
`README.md`, a `LICENSE` that preserves the original credit **and** the new maintainer, a manifest
with your `basePath`, `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml` for your `siteUrl`, `.nojekyll`, `.gitignore` and
`.editorconfig`. Flags: `--out`, `--no-zip`, `--config`.

### Single-file version (one HTML file)

Need the whole site in **one file** — to paste into a Gist, CodePen, an email, or any host
without folders? The generator inlines HTML, CSS, JS and the icon:

```bash
python3 tools/single-file.py             # writes single/index.html (~230 KB)
python3 tools/single-file.py --out /tmp/luminsdk.html
```

It opens straight in a browser: no server, no build. The only external piece is the LuminSDK
script from the CDN (Google Fonts are optional and fall back gracefully).

> **About Pastebin:** Pastebin raw is served as `text/plain`, so the browser shows the code
> instead of the page. To get a URL that actually renders, use a Gist plus `raw.githack.com`,
> CodePen, JSFiddle, or GitHub Pages.

The generated copy lives in [`single/`](single/) →
`https://suckinguptoessry.github.io/LuminSDK/single/`.

## How the integration works

The site runs the SDK in **headless mode** — LuminSDK provides the data and the game URLs,
this project provides the interface:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/luminsdk/script@latest/lumin.min.js"></script>
<script>
  await Lumin.init({ headless: true });

  const { games, total, pages } = await Lumin.getGames({ page: 1, limit: 24, q: 'puzzle' });

  const cover = await Lumin.getImageUrl(games[0].image_token);

  const { url } = await Lumin.getGameUrl(games[0].id);
  iframe.src = url;
</script>
```

| Method | Used for |
|---|---|
| `Lumin.init({ headless: true })` | Connect without rendering the default UI |
| `Lumin.getGames({ page, limit, q })` | Paginated grid and search |
| `Lumin.getRandomGames(n)` | “Random” button |
| `Lumin.getCategories()` | Category chips and counter |
| `Lumin.getImageUrl(token)` | Lazy-loaded game covers |
| `Lumin.getGameUrl(id)` | Custom fullscreen player |
| `Lumin.loadGame(id)` | Fallback player |

### Games hosted elsewhere

A few titles do not run in the LuminSDK player but on an external site. Those live in
`CONFIG.customSources` at the top of `assets/js/library.js`:

```js
customSources: [
  {
    id: 'selenite/undertale',
    name: 'undertale',
    url: 'https://toby.booksforschool.online/index.html#z4x',
    label: 'Toby Web'
  }
]
```

The match is the catalog `id` first and the **exact** name as a fallback, so `Undertale Yellow`
(another id) keeps opening in the normal player. Opening one of these titles shows a badge in the
player header (e.g. “Toby Web”) with the destination domain as a tooltip; if the page refuses to
load in the iframe, the “open in a new tab” button is the way out.

Full API reference: **[docs.luminsdk.com](https://docs.luminsdk.com/)**.

## Customization

```css
html[data-theme="dark"] {
  --violet: #8b5cf6;   /* primary accent */
  --cyan:   #22d3ee;   /* gradients and glows */
  --bg:     #07070c;   /* background */
  --text:   #f4f4fa;   /* text */
}
```

| Change | Where |
|---|---|
| Copy, links and branding | `index.html` |
| Colors, fonts, radii | `:root` in `assets/css/styles.css` |
| Games per page and columns | `layoutInfo()` in `assets/js/library.js` (or the on-page sliders) |
| Card sizes (S/M/L) | `CONFIG.cardSizes` in `assets/js/library.js` |
| Device detection | `detectDevice()` in `assets/js/settings.js` |
| Performance presets | `PRESETS` in `assets/js/settings.js` |
| Personal suggestion | `buildSuggestion()` in `assets/js/settings.js` |
| Achievements and goals | `ACHIEVEMENTS` in `assets/js/progress.js` |
| Daily challenges | `dailyChallenges()` in `assets/js/progress.js` |
| Recommendations | `preferredCategories()` in `assets/js/library.js` |
| Default accent color | `--accent` in `:root` (`assets/css/styles.css`) |
| Quick palette presets | `PRESETS` in `assets/js/atmosphere.js` |
| Max categories shown | `CONFIG.maxCategories` in `assets/js/library.js` |
| Default theme | `applyTheme()` in `assets/js/site.js` |

Add `?demo` to the URL to preview the interface with placeholder cards while offline.

There are **no keyboard shortcuts** in the site — no `F` (fullscreen), `R` (random), `/` or
`Ctrl`+`K` (search), `?` (settings). Everything lives in the UI buttons so no key is stolen from
the game. With the player open, every key (WASD, arrows, space, Enter, F, numbers…) goes to the game.

The game runs in a cross-origin `<iframe>`, so the player focuses it as soon as it loads (and retries
a few times), restores focus when the tab/window becomes active again and never uses a modal
`<dialog>` — some browsers never give keyboard focus to an iframe inside a modal dialog. Games that
run inside another iframe and block focus on click can be opened with **Open in a new tab**.

---

### Bonus tools

The **Bonus** button in the header opens a small toolbox that runs entirely in the browser:

- **Gamepad tester** — live view of every button, trigger and stick (Gamepad API via polling),
  with an adjustable dead zone, raw readout and a rumble test when the controller and browser
  support it. Built with the **Xbox Edge browser** in mind: no Web Bluetooth, WebUSB, Keyboard Lock
  or experimental APIs.
- **Connection monitor** — online/offline state, network type, estimated speed and latency when the
  browser exposes them, plus a real latency test against the site itself.
- **Cache manager** — storage used, stored caches, service worker state, an update check and a safe
  clear-and-reload action.
- **Daily challenges** — three goals that rotate at midnight, with progress bars and the streak of
  days you closed all three.
- **Statistics** — sessions, total time, games and categories, day streak, a last-7-days chart,
  most played and a reset button.
- **Achievements** — 17 medals with progress, automatic unlocking and a toast when one drops
  (secret ones only reveal their hint once unlocked).

The panel only lists what already works. The next batch — collections, quick launch, game layout,
immersive mode and full backup — ships in upcoming updates.

---

## Accessibility & performance

- Semantic landmarks, `aria-live` status and result announcements, plus a skip link.
- Fully keyboard navigable with visible `:focus-visible` styles.
- Covers loaded via `IntersectionObserver`, only when near the viewport.
- No framework and no bundler; Google Fonts has a system-font fallback.
- Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` and ships native light/dark themes.

### Lightweight by default (same visuals)

| What | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| PWA and brand icons | 292 KB | **87 KB** (256-colour PNGs, mean error ~2/255) |
| First visit (HTML + CSS + JS + images) | ~647 KB | **~446 KB** |
| Service worker pre-cache | ~700 KB on `install` | **~330 KB** (essential shell only) |

- **Reused cards:** search, filtering and pagination no longer rebuild the whole grid — unchanged
  cards keep their DOM nodes, so there are no extra cover requests and no flicker.
- **Cursor:** the animation loop runs only while the ring is still catching up with the pointer.
- **Particles:** pause automatically while a game is open.
- **Player:** the fullscreen backdrop blur is disabled during play.
- **Below the fold:** FAQ, open-source and footer use `content-visibility: auto`.
